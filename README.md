About cunySecond

The objective of this project is to build a cunyfirst similar system in command line. The choice of programing language is c#. cunyfirst is a unified academic management software, serving all city universities of NY. It is used for managing centralized students' transactions including enrollment, class registration, employment, career and many more. It also allows faculties to manage their departments. cunyfirst is not a perfect system but it embraces a lot of object oriented approaches that are worth learning.

Things to keep in mind as we learn C# with this project.
